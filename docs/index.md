# Mod Engine 3 Manager

ME3 Manager is a simple app for installing and managing mods for FromSoftware games — no command line needed. It works alongside [Mod Engine 3](https://me3.help/) and guides you through installing it on first launch.

## What you can do

- Install mods by dragging files/folders into the app
- Create profiles to switch between different mod setups
- Manage multiple games and configure game-specific options
- Quickly enable/disable mods and see status at a glance

## Why did I make this?

Installing and uninstalling mods with ME3 used to mean editing profiles and shuffling folders by hand. ME3 Manager automates the boring parts so you can focus on playing.

Special thanks to [Gary Tierney ](https://github.com/garyttierney)for creating Mod Engine 3 — this project wouldn’t exist without it.
