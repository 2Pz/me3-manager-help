A new feature will be added that allows you to create Steam shortcuts for your profiles.
This is especially useful if you prefer running ME3 directly from Steam (**without using the ME3 Manager GUI**).

After adding the profile, you will need to **restart Steam** for the changes to take effect.
Once restarted, youâ€™ll see the profile listed in Steam as a non-Steam game.
