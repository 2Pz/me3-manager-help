## Supported types

- DLL files (.dll)
- Mod folders
- Regulation files (.bin)

### 1) DLL mod example

For example, installing the Storm Control mod:

- Drag the `.dll` file into the drop zone
- Confirm and it will appear in the list

### 2) Package mod example

Some mods include a `.me3` profile and a `mods` folder (e.g., a large overhaul).

- Drag only `.me3` or both the `.me3` file and the folder together
- If there is no `.me3` file, drag the folder

### 3) Regulation.bin

Some mods contain only a `regulation.bin` file.

- Drag it into the drop zone
- Note: only one regulation file can be active at a time
